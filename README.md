## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        - It should be easy for a first time visitor to see the purpose of the game and to intiutively figure out how it is played or find out how.
        - A first time visitor should leave the game with a nice feeling and a desire to come back.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to easily just play the game without any detours. 
        - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to choose a harder, or easier, level of the game than I tried before.
